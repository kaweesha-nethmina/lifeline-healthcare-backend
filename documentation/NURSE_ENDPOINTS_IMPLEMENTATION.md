# Nurse Endpoints Implementation

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of comprehensive nurse endpoints for the Lifeline Smart Healthcare System. The implementation includes all requested functionality for nurses to manage patients, appointments, vitals, and care records.

## Database Schema Updates

### New Tables Added
1. **nurse_vitals** - Stores patient vital signs recorded by nurses
2. **nurse_care_records** - Stores detailed care records for patients

### Table Structures

#### Nurse Vitals
```sql
CREATE TABLE nurse_vitals (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    patient_id INTEGER REFERENCES patients(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    nurse_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    vital_signs TEXT,
    recorded_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

#### Nurse Care Records
```sql
CREATE TABLE nurse_care_records (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    patient_id INTEGER REFERENCES patients(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    nurse_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    care_details TEXT,
    medication_administered TEXT,
    notes TEXT,
    recorded_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

## Implemented Endpoints

### 1. Patient Management
- **GET /nurses/patients** - Get all patients in the system

### 2. Appointment Management
- **GET /nurses/appointments** - Get all appointments in the system
- **PUT /nurses/appointments/:id/status** - Update appointment status

### 3. Vitals Management
- **POST /nurses/patients/:id/vitals** - Add vitals for a patient
- **GET /nurses/patients/:id/vitals** - Get patient vitals history

### 4. Care Records Management
- **POST /nurses/patients/:id/care-records** - Add care record for a patient
- **GET /nurses/patients/:id/care-records** - Get care records for a patient
- **PUT /nurses/care-records/:recordId** - Update a care record
- **DELETE /nurses/care-records/:recordId** - Delete a care record

### 5. Existing Endpoints (Updated)
- **POST /nurses/patients/:id/care** - Update patient care information
- **GET /nurses/patients/:id/care** - Get patient care history

## Files Modified/Added

### Modified Files:
1. `models/Nurse.js` - Added all new methods for nurse functionality
2. `controllers/nurseController.js` - Added all new controller functions
3. `routes/nurses.js` - Added all new routes
4. `API_DOCUMENTATION.md` - Added documentation for all new endpoints and database tables
5. `Lifeline_Healthcare_API_Updated.postman_collection.json` - Added all new requests to Postman collection

## Key Features

### Security
- All endpoints are protected with JWT authentication
- Only authorized nurses can access these endpoints
- Proper error handling prevents information leakage

### Data Integrity
- Foreign key constraints ensure data consistency
- CASCADE deletes maintain referential integrity
- Timestamps track all changes

### Functionality
- Comprehensive patient management
- Full appointment status tracking
- Detailed vitals recording
- Complete care records management

## Testing

All endpoints have been added to the Postman collection with example requests and can be tested using the following steps:

1. Obtain a valid nurse JWT token through the authentication process
2. Set the `auth_token` variable in Postman
3. Execute any of the nurse endpoints with appropriate parameters

## Future Improvements

Potential enhancements that could be made in the future:
1. Add pagination for large result sets
2. Implement search and filtering capabilities
3. Add audit logging for all nurse activities
4. Implement real-time notifications for critical vitals
