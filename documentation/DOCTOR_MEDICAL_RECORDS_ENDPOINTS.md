# Doctor Medical Records Endpoints

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of new medical records endpoints for doctors, including get, update, and delete functionality for individual medical records.

## New Endpoints Implemented

### 1. Get Medical Record by ID
- **Endpoint:** `GET /doctors/medical-records/:recordId`
- **Description:** Allows doctors to retrieve a specific medical record by its ID
- **Authentication:** Required (JWT token)
- **Parameters:** 
  - `recordId` (path parameter) - Medical Record ID

### 2. Update Medical Record
- **Endpoint:** `PUT /doctors/medical-records/:recordId`
- **Description:** Allows doctors to update a specific medical record by its ID
- **Authentication:** Required (JWT token)
- **Parameters:** 
  - `recordId` (path parameter) - Medical Record ID
- **Request Body:** (All fields optional)
  - `diagnosis` - Updated diagnosis
  - `treatment_plan` - Updated treatment plan
  - `prescriptions` - Updated prescriptions

### 3. Delete Medical Record
- **Endpoint:** `DELETE /doctors/medical-records/:recordId`
- **Description:** Allows doctors to delete a specific medical record by its ID
- **Authentication:** Required (JWT token)
- **Parameters:** 
  - `recordId` (path parameter) - Medical Record ID

## Implementation Details

### Backend Files Modified

#### 1. Models (`models/MedicalRecord.js`)
- Created new `MedicalRecord` model
- Added `getMedicalRecordById` method
- Added `updateMedicalRecord` method
- Added `deleteMedicalRecord` method
- Added prescription management methods
- Added `deletePrescriptionByMedicalRecord` helper method

#### 2. Controllers (`controllers/doctorController.js`)
- Added `getMedicalRecordById` function
- Added `updateMedicalRecord` function
- Added `deleteMedicalRecord` function
- All functions include proper error handling and authentication checks
- All functions verify doctor-patient appointment relationship

#### 3. Routes (`routes/doctors.js`)
- Added `GET /medical-records/:recordId` route
- Added `PUT /medical-records/:recordId` route
- Added `DELETE /medical-records/:recordId` route

### Security Features
1. **Appointment Relationship Verification:** All operations verify that the doctor has an appointment relationship with the patient
2. **Authentication Required:** All endpoints require a valid JWT token
3. **Input Validation:** Only specified fields can be updated
4. **Error Handling:** Proper error responses for various failure scenarios
5. **Cascading Deletes:** When deleting a medical record, all associated prescriptions are also deleted

## API Usage Examples

### Get Medical Record
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:5000/doctors/medical-records/1 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"
```

### Update Medical Record
```bash
curl -X PUT http://localhost:5000/doctors/medical-records/1 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "diagnosis": "Updated Hypertension",
    "treatment_plan": "Continue medication and lifestyle changes",
    "prescriptions": "Lisinopril 10mg daily, Metoprolol 25mg daily"
  }'
```

### Delete Medical Record
```bash
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:5000/doctors/medical-records/1 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"
```

## Response Formats

### Successful Get
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "patient_id": 1,
  "doctor_id": 1,
  "diagnosis": "Hypertension",
  "treatment_plan": "Prescribed medication and lifestyle changes",
  "prescriptions": "Lisinopril 10mg daily",
  "record_date": "2025-10-15T10:00:00Z",
  "updated_at": "2025-10-15T10:00:00Z"
}
```

### Successful Update
```json
{
  "message": "Medical record updated successfully",
  "data": {
    "id": 1,
    "patient_id": 1,
    "doctor_id": 1,
    "diagnosis": "Updated Hypertension",
    "treatment_plan": "Continue medication and lifestyle changes",
    "prescriptions": "Lisinopril 10mg daily, Metoprolol 25mg daily",
    "record_date": "2025-10-15T10:00:00Z",
    "updated_at": "2025-10-15T17:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

### Successful Deletion
```json
{
  "message": "Medical record deleted successfully",
  "data": {
    "id": 1,
    "patient_id": 1,
    "doctor_id": 1,
    "diagnosis": "Hypertension",
    "treatment_plan": "Prescribed medication and lifestyle changes",
    "prescriptions": "Lisinopril 10mg daily",
    "record_date": "2025-10-15T10:00:00Z",
    "updated_at": "2025-10-15T17:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

## Error Handling

### Common Error Responses
1. **404 Not Found:** Medical record not found or doesn't belong to a patient the doctor has treated
2. **401 Unauthorized:** Missing or invalid JWT token
3. **403 Forbidden:** No appointment relationship between doctor and patient
4. **500 Internal Server Error:** Database or server errors

### Example Error Response
```json
{
  "error": "Access denied. No appointment found with this patient."
}
```

## Testing

### Test Scenarios
1. **Valid Get:** Doctor retrieves a medical record for a patient they have treated
2. **Valid Update:** Doctor updates a medical record for a patient they have treated
3. **Valid Deletion:** Doctor deletes a medical record for a patient they have treated
4. **Unauthorized Access:** Doctor tries to access/update/delete a medical record for a patient they haven't treated
5. **Invalid Record ID:** Doctor tries to access/update/delete non-existent medical record
6. **Partial Update:** Doctor updates only some fields in a medical record

## Benefits

1. **Complete Medical Record Management:** Doctors can now fully manage individual medical records
2. **Security:** Appointment relationship verification prevents unauthorized access
3. **Flexibility:** Partial updates allow doctors to modify only specific fields
4. **Consistency:** New endpoints follow the same patterns as existing endpoints
5. **Documentation:** Complete API documentation with examples
6. **Data Integrity:** Cascading deletes ensure no orphaned prescription records

## Future Considerations

1. **Audit Trail:** Log medical record changes for tracking purposes
2. **Validation Rules:** Implement business rules for medical record content
3. **Notification System:** Send notifications to patients when medical records are updated
4. **Versioning:** Implement medical record versioning to track changes over time
