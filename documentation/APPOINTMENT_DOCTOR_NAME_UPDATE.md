# Appointment History Enhancement Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the enhancement made to the patient appointment history endpoint to include doctor names in the response.

## Change Details

### Modified File
- **File:** `models/Patient.js`
- **Function:** `getAppointmentHistory`

### Enhancement
- Updated the Supabase query to join with the `doctors` table and then with the `users` table
- Added `users (name)` to the select query to retrieve doctor names
- Added a `doctor_name` field to the response at the top level for easier consumption
- Maintained backward compatibility by keeping the existing nested structure

### Response Format
The appointment history endpoint now returns data in the following format:
```json
[
  {
    "id": 9,
    "patient_id": 1,
    "doctor_id": 3,
    "appointment_date": "2025-10-17T06:32:00+00:00",
    "status": "booked",
    "created_at": "2025-10-15T16:33:51.706967+00:00",
    "updated_at": "2025-10-15T16:33:51.706967+00:00",
    "doctors": {
      "user_id": 11,
      "specialty": "Cardiology",
      "users": {
        "name": "Dr. John Smith"
      }
    },
    "doctor_name": "Dr. John Smith"
  }
]
```

### Benefits
1. **Easier Consumption:** Frontend applications can now directly access the doctor's name through the `doctor_name` field
2. **Backward Compatibility:** Existing applications using the nested `doctors.users.name` path will continue to work
3. **Better User Experience:** Patients can see doctor names directly in their appointment history without additional API calls

## Testing
The endpoint has been updated and should be tested to ensure:
1. Doctor names are correctly retrieved and displayed
2. Appointments without associated doctors are handled gracefully
3. The response format matches the documented structure
