# Admin User Management Endpoints Implementation

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of new admin endpoints for editing and deleting users in the Lifeline Smart Healthcare System.

## Changes Made

### 1. Model Updates (models/Admin.js)
- Added `updateUser(userId, userData)` method to update user information
- Added `deleteUser(userId)` method to delete users and their role-specific records

### 2. Controller Updates (controllers/adminController.js)
- Added `updateUser` function to handle user update requests
- Added `deleteUser` function to handle user deletion requests

### 3. Route Updates (routes/admin.js)
- Added `PUT /admin/users/:id` route for updating users
- Added `DELETE /admin/users/:id` route for deleting users

### 4. API Documentation Updates (API_DOCUMENTATION.md)
- Added documentation for the new Update User endpoint
- Added documentation for the new Delete User endpoint

### 5. Postman Collection Updates (Lifeline_Healthcare_API_Updated.postman_collection.json)
- Added "Update User" request to the Admin folder
- Added "Delete User" request to the Admin folder

## Endpoint Details

### Update User
- **Method**: PUT
- **URL**: `/admin/users/:id`
- **Description**: Updates a user's information (admin only)
- **Authentication**: Required (Admin token)
- **Parameters**: User ID in URL path
- **Request Body**: JSON object with user fields to update

### Delete User
- **Method**: DELETE
- **URL**: `/admin/users/:id`
- **Description**: Deletes a user from the system (admin only)
- **Authentication**: Required (Admin token)
- **Parameters**: User ID in URL path

## Implementation Notes

1. The update functionality prevents modification of critical fields like email and password
2. The delete functionality properly handles cascading deletion of role-specific records
3. All endpoints are protected and only accessible by admin users
4. Proper error handling is implemented for all new endpoints

## Testing
The new endpoints have been added to the Postman collection and can be tested using the provided requests.
