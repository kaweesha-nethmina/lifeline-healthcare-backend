}
```
- **Description:** Updates a specific medical record with the specified ID

- **Description:** Deletes a specific medical record with the specified ID

## Implementation Details

### Request Structure
1. **Authentication:** All endpoints require a valid JWT token in the Authorization header
2. **Path Parameters:** All endpoints use the medical record ID as a path parameter
3. **Request Body:** Update endpoint accepts a JSON body with optional fields
4. **Response Format:** Standard JSON responses with success messages

### Update Medical Record Request Body
The update medical record endpoint accepts any combination of the following fields:
- `diagnosis` - Updated diagnosis information
- `treatment_plan` - Updated treatment plan
- `prescriptions` - Updated prescriptions

All fields are optional, allowing for partial updates.

### Security Features
1. **Authentication Required:** All endpoints require a valid JWT token
2. **Path Parameter:** Medical record ID is required in the URL path
3. **Backend Validation:** The backend verifies that the doctor has an appointment relationship with the patient
4. **Authorization:** Doctors can only access medical records for patients they have treated

## Testing Scenarios

### Valid Get
1. Send GET request to `/doctors/medical-records/1` with valid JWT token
2. Expect 200 OK response with medical record data

### Valid Update
1. Send PUT request to `/doctors/medical-records/1` with valid JWT token
2. Include updated medical record data in request body
3. Expect 200 OK response with updated medical record data

### Valid Deletion
1. Send DELETE request to `/doctors/medical-records/1` with valid JWT token
2. Expect 200 OK response with deleted medical record data

### Invalid Authentication
1. Send request without JWT token or with invalid token
2. Expect 401 Unauthorized response

### Non-existent Medical Record
1. Send request with valid JWT token but non-existent medical record ID
2. Expect 404 Not Found response

### Unauthorized Access
1. Send request with valid JWT token for a medical record that belongs to a patient the doctor hasn't treated
2. Expect 403 Forbidden response

## Benefits

1. **Complete Testing Coverage:** Postman collection now includes all medical records management endpoints
2. **Consistent Structure:** New endpoints follow the same naming and organization conventions
3. **Clear Documentation:** Each endpoint includes example request bodies and descriptions
4. **Easy Testing:** Ready-to-use requests that can be executed with minimal modification

## Usage Instructions

### Setting up Authentication
1. Execute the "Login User" request to obtain a JWT token
2. The test script automatically saves the token to the `auth_token` environment variable
3. All doctor endpoints will automatically use this token

### Testing Get Endpoint
1. Modify the medical record ID in the URL if needed
2. Execute the request

### Testing Update Endpoint
1. Modify the medical record ID in the URL if needed
2. Update the request body with desired changes
3. Execute the request

### Testing Delete Endpoint
1. Modify the medical record ID in the URL if needed
2. Execute the request

## Future Considerations

1. **Environment Variables:** Consider using environment variables for medical record IDs
2. **Test Scripts:** Add test scripts to verify response data
3. **Collections:** Organize requests into folders for better management
4. **Examples:** Add more example requests for different scenarios
5. **Validation:** Add request validation to ensure proper data formats
