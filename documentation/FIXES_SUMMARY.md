# Fixes Summary

This document summarizes the fixes made to resolve the errors encountered with the admin report endpoints.

## Issues Fixed

1. **Column medical_records.created_at does not exist**
   - Fixed by using `record_date` instead of `created_at` in the medical records queries
   - Updated in the Admin model methods for report generation

2. **this.supabase.from(...).select(...).group is not a function**
   - Fixed by replacing `.group()` calls with manual grouping logic
   - Updated in the Admin model methods for report generation

3. **Column appointments.reason does not exist**
   - Fixed by removing references to the non-existent `reason` column
   - Replaced with `notes` field which exists in the appointments table
   - Updated in:
     - Admin model [generateAppointmentReport](file://f:\SLIIT\3rd%20Year\2nd%20sem\CSSE\Assignment%2002\models\Admin.js#L228-L285) method
     - API documentation
     - Postman collection examples

## Files Modified

1. **models/Admin.js**
   - Fixed medical records queries to use `record_date` instead of `created_at`
   - Replaced `.group()` calls with manual grouping logic
   - Removed references to non-existent `reason` column in appointments
   - Added `location` field to appointment queries

2. **API_DOCUMENTATION.md**
   - Updated all examples to remove `reason` field
   - Added `location` field to appointment examples
   - Updated `notes` field usage

3. **Lifeline_Healthcare_API_Complete.postman_collection.json**

## Verification

All endpoints should now work correctly:
- `GET /admin/reports/appointments` - Generate appointment report
- `GET /admin/reports/appointments/statistics` - Get appointment statistics
- `GET /admin/reports/doctors/performance` - Get doctor performance report
- `GET /admin/reports/users/activity` - Generate monthly user activity report
- `GET /admin/reports/medical-records/summary` - Get medical records summary

The fixes ensure that:
1. All database column references are correct
2. All Supabase client methods are used properly
3. All response examples match the actual database schema
